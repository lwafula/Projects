	* Chi-square tests for testing expected vs observed frequences
	* ANOVA for testing differences in responses amongst treatments
	* binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) by ML/laplace approximation to assess the main
	  and interaction effects of time/variable and treatment on the fraction of subjects that experienced
	  a condition; aquarium ID and daily observations can be included as random effects. Aquarium ID

	* use of non-parametric methods if we do not want to make assumptions e.g for normality, e.g,
	Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA to test differences amongst groups, adjusting for multiple comparisons using 
      Dunn's multiple comparison test as a post-hoc adjustment

Steve Abrams: Modeling infectious diseases
	* Integration of survival data techniques in infectious disease epidemiology, 
	* outbreak risk assessment in highly vaccinated populations
	* ANOVA to compare differences in a given epidemiological score among participants from different groups
	* longitudinal data analysis to determine socio-economic and behavioral factors for a given disease
		- binary longitudinal data (for presence or absence of a cardiovascular disease)
	* two-sample t-tests  and chi-square tests for numerical and categorical variables for comparison
	of responses among individuals of different characteristics
	* To estimate the populationaveraged effect of socioeconomic, behavioral and physical determinants 
	on the occurrence ofCVD, we developed two independent marginal models using multivariable 
	Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) with the binomial distribution and logit link function [21]. 
      GEE accounts for within-subject association and allows to estimate the between-subject effects of 
      the relationships of determinants with the occurrence of CVD over the observation period

Steven Van Laere - Oncology

	* Use of supervised and unsupervised cluster analysis (wald, manhattan distances) as a first approach 
       to uncover molecular clusters of breast cancer patients before applying survival analysis to help
	understand when the condition sets in and the factors that drive acquisition of the condition: 
	cox proportional model, generalized linear models, non-parameteric models e.g to compare continuous
	data among two or more groups; Kruskall-wallis/Mann-Whitney, to compare distribution of categorical
	variables; chi-square/Fisher Exact test

Sunčica Vujić -  applied econometrics
	* cross-sectional, panel data and time-series data analysis methods, longitudinal data analysis

	- longitudinal data on students smartphone use and educational performance; panel data random 
	effects estimation controlling for unobserved individual characteristics: linear mixed model

	- In statistics and econometrics, panel data and longitudinal data are both multi-dimensional data
	 involving measurements over time. Panel data is a subset of longitudinal data where observations are for the same subjects each time
	
	- In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a 
	  time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a 
        sequence of discrete-time data.

 The questions for this task are listed below. 


 Q1: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variables "Gender" and "Employed" (with the interaction term). Calculate the prediction interval for  Gender=M, Employed =30. Give the upperbound of this interval. 

 Q2: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Experience". Give the Cook’s distance of observation 35 multiplied by 1000. 

 Q3: Perform a one-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factor "Department". Afterwards, test all pairwise contrasts with the Tukey method. For how many contrasts is the difference between group means significantly different from zero, if we use α = 0.05 ? 

 Q4: Explain the "Salary" in terms of "Employed", "Gender" and "Department". Is there a difference in the salaries by department when one controls for years employed and gender? Provide the p-value associated with the Type II SS for department. 


 Don't forget to round decimals to three digits.

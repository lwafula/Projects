 Q1: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variables "Gender" and "Employed" (with the interaction term). Calculate the 95% prediction interval for  Gender=F, Employed =30. Give the upperbound of this interval. 

 Q2: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Experience". Give the Cook's distance of observation 35 multiplied by 1000. 

 Q3: Perform a one-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factor "Department". Afterwards, test all pairwise contrasts with the Tukey method. Give the p-value of the contrast "Department 3 - Department 2". 

 Q4: Explain the "Salary" in terms of "Experience", "Gender" and "Department". Is there a difference in the salaries by department when one controls for experience and gender? Provide the p-value associated with the Type II SS for department. 


 Don't forget to round decimals to three digits.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{python}

N = 101

total = 0

for i in range(1, N, 1):
  
  total += i
  
print(total)
  
```


## Embedding R?

```{r}

total = 0
N = 100

for( i in 1:N){
 
  total = total + i 
}

```

The total of the first `r N` is `r total`.

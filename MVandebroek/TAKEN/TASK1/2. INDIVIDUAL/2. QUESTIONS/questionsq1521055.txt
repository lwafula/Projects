 Q1: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variables "Gender" and "Employed" (with the interaction term). Calculate the prediction interval for  Gender=M, Employed =30. Give the upperbound of this interval. 

 Q2: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Experience". Give the Cookâ€™s distance of observation 35 multiplied by 1000. 

 Q3: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Employed". Give the hat-value of observation 20. 

 Q4: Assume you want to perform a one-way ANOVA. You expect the group means to be 55, 60, 57 en 62. Assume that the standard deviation within the groups equals 5. What is the power of the global F-test if there would be 10 observations in each group, given a significance level of 0,05.

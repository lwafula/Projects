 The questions for this task are listed below. 


 Q1: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variables "Gender" and "Employed" (with the interaction term). Calculate the prediction interval for Gender=F, Employed =30. Give the lowerbound of this interval. 

 Q2: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Education". Give the Cook’s distance of observation 15 multiplied by 1000. 

 Q3: Perform a one-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factor "Department". Afterwards, test all pairwise contrasts with the Tukey method. For how many contrasts is the difference between group means significantly different from zero, if we use α = 0.05 ? 

 Q4: Perform a two-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factors "Gender" and "Department" (with interaction effect). Give the p-value of the interaction effect.

 - if we use the binary DCE model, what happens to the rank? because, indifferent choice is for neither, 
and then there are several ranks for the left/right choice. this is not necessarily -ve and/or +ve case. 

 - models for the first DCEs and the last ranking connected with the same parameters? introduce a 'consistency' 
parameter for the last three section? Since we're using basically the same attributes in the two sections and responses can be rescaled to [0, 1]

 - simulated data for this experiment: based on this linear model only and see ; and the ratings
 - simulated ranked data
 - dplyr
 - introduction to R: a short intro (for dplyr)
 - send with intro to R & dplyr slides
 - find good questions from the sports data


Analysis of ranked data

 - Luce model: with independent utilities assigned to each of the items/options. Covariates can also be included
 - distance-based model

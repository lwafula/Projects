QUIZ:
1. QbD used/employed?


JnJ projects

12. Reviewing papers:

	- Extended Youden design for biological assays that provides nearly orthogonal designs in cases where multiple factors are to be controlled but you cannot
	achieve orthogonality for all of them simultaneously e.g., if you need at least one row on each plate to have a standard treatment, it is impossible to 
	achieve orthogonality for other nuisance factors like location since you cannot eliminate heterogeneity for both cases. For one, a BIBD would do, but 
      extending it to more than factor is problematic 
	

11. Dissolution similarity using f2 bootstraping + sample size calculation; whether to bootstrap within baths or batches

	- if asked: talk of rewriting R code for implementation in a local R package to allow for bootstrapping within baths as opposed to only within batches
	- plus having an shiny-app so that scientists do not have to wait for a statistician to work on it for routine cases

10. process performance qualification (ppq)

9. Design and analysis of experiments, comparability and product stability, shelf-life calculations and specifications

8. DoEs; robustness tests

7. process capability and statistical process control

6. analytical method validation

5. dissolution modeling and sample size calculation

4. content uniformity; ASTM

3. sample size calculation to help pass different CQA specs

2. probability of success (pos) for different CQAs given their spec limits

1. Dissolution of drugs at release, stability of different dissolution timepoints and pos for dissolution using different strategies

NOTES:

Process capability

4. Robustness DoE in JMP (e.g., split plots, definitive screening designs)

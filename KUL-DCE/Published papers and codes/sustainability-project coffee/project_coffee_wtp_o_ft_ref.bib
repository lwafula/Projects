Firstly, we study whether consumers are able to identify the environmental and social labels associated with a particular good or service. Secondly, we analyze whether consumers find the product information implied by the presence of a label trustworthy. Thirdly, we examine the desirability, including taste, of sustainably produced goods compared to conventional goods. Fourthly we calculate consumers' marginal willingness to pay for environment-friendly and socially desirable goods, and finally, we identify groups of consumers with different preference patterns. Specifically, we performed a survey including a stated choice experiment of consumer decisions concerning the purchase of chocolate in Flanders (Belgium), focusing on fair trade and organic labels. Overall, we find that fair trade labels for chocolate are more likely to influence consumer choice than organic labels in Flanders. For most of the consumers the organic label seems to become superfluous when selecting a self-indulgent treat such as chocolate.},

abstract = {Organic farming is an approach to agriculture that emphasises environmental protection, animal welfare, sustainable resource use and social justice objectives, utilising the market to help support those objectives and compensate for the internalisation of externalities. Although organic farming as a concept has existed for over 80 years, only since the mid-1980s has it become the focus of significant attention from policy-makers, consumers, environmentalists and farmers in Europe. In 1991, the EU introduced legislation to define organic crop production (EC Reg. 2092191) followed by livestock production in 1999 (EC Reg. 180411999). Consumer demand for organic food has risen sharply, leading to the active involvement of multiple retailers and substantially higher prices at the farm gate than those received in the conventional sector. A more widespread application of policies for supporting conversion to nd continued organic farming came into effect in 1992 when support to organic farming was included as one measure in the agri-environment programme (EC Reg. 2078192), an accompanying measure of CAP reform. This has been continued under the Agenda 2000 rural development programme (EC Reg. 125711999). As a result, policy support for organic farming is now widely available across Europe, in recognition of its contribution to surplus reduction, environmental and rural development policy objectives. These factors have contributed to substantial growth in supply, helping market development by increasing availability of products and raw materials, but in some cases also leading to oversupply problems and downward price pressures. As a consequence, more emphasis is now being placed on the development of action plans at local, national and EU levels, integrating supply-push and demand-pull policy measures. This paper documents the development of the organic sector, reviews the support policies in the various EU countries prior to and after the reforms of the CAP in 1992 and 2000, and discusses likely future directions in policy development.(2).},

abstract = {Despite their ethical intentions, ethically minded consumers rarely purchase ethical products (Auger and Devinney: 2007, Journal of Business Ethics 76, 361-383). This intentions-behaviour gap is important to researchers and industry, yet poorly understood (Belk et al.: 2005, Consumption, Markets and Culture 8(3), 275-289). In order to push the understanding of ethical consumption forward, we draw on what is known about the intention behaviour gap from the social psychology and consumer behaviour literatures and apply these insights to ethical consumerism. We bring together three separate insights implementation intentions (Gollwitzer: 1999, American Psychologist 54(7), 493-503), actual behavioural control (ABC) (Ajzen and Madden: 1986, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 22, 453-474; Sheeran et al.: 2003, Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 393-410) and situational context (SC) (Belk: 1975, Journal of Consumer Research 2, 157 164) to construct an integrated, holistic conceptual model of the intention behaviour gap of ethically minded consumers. This holistic conceptual model addresses significant limitations within the ethical consumerism literature, and moves the understanding of ethical consumer behaviour forward. Further, the operationalisation of this model offers insight and strategic direction for marketing managers attempting to bridge the intention-behaviour gap of the ethically minded consumer.},

This article contributes to an understanding of this “ethical purchasing gap” through a review of existing literature, and the inductive analysis of focus group discussions. A model is suggested which includes exogenous variables such as moral maturity and age which have been well covered in the literature, together with further impeding factors identified from the focus group discussions. For some consumers, inertia in purchasing behaviour was such that the decision-making process was devoid of ethical considerations. Several manifested their ethical views through post-purchase dissonance and retrospective feelings of guilt. Others displayed a reluctance to consume ethically due to personal constraints, a perceived negative impact on image or quality, or an outright negation of responsibility. Those who expressed a desire to consume ethically often seemed deterred by cynicism, which caused them to question the impact they, as an individual, could achieve. These findings enhance the understanding of ethical consumption decisions and provide a platform for future research in this area.},

abstract = {Individuals are confronted with the difficulty of making choices throughout their lives. The desire to behave ethically can be one motive for a certain choice. People's wish to support philanthropic, sustainable, ecological and social issues can lead to different forms of ethical behaviour, such as the purchase of products with ethical characteristics and charitable giving. In the market place, it can be observed that a recent aspect of consumer demand in western countries is the growing interest in products which have certain ethical features. Market shares of these goods are growing but still small. At the same time volumes of charitable giving are stagnating at a high level in Germany. Due to budget constraints the financial means of households for ethical behaviour are limited. Against this background, the objective of the thesis is to elaborate differences and similarities of forms of ethical behaviour in general and to analyse whether German consumers differentiate between different types of ethical behaviour in particular. Accordingly, the thesis is divided into four parts. In part A, an introduction to the topic is given. This is followed by part B entitled 'ethics and consumers' choice' as this discusses first, the foundations of consumers' decision making and approaches to measure consumer preferences and second, provides an overview and a comparison of ethical consumption, Fair Trade, charitable giving to form a basis for the empirical studies. The empirical studies follow in part C, entitled 'empirical studies based on the example of coffee'. In this section, five papers present the results of three empirical studies with sample sizes from n = 112 to n = 484 conducted in 2008 and 2009. Each of the papers addresses different sub-questions of the overall research question. At the end of the thesis, the major results are summarised in part D and the findings from the theoretical part and the empirical studies are brought together in a synthesis. One of the most relevant outcomes is that all five papers reveal that consumers in Germany have well-defined preferences for the different forms of ethical behaviour and can be distinguished accordingly. Most of the study participants regard the different possibilities of ethical behaviour as complements. However, consumers could also be identified who regard e.g. charitable giving and the purchase of CrM products as substitutes. Accordingly, market segmentation is required to address the different consumer groups appropriately to prevent substitution of the different means of ethical behaviour. The determinants of ethical behaviour identified in the papers, such as a positive attitude towards charitable organisations, can be used for that purpose. Another prominent result is that consumers' stated preferences for ethical product features are reflected in their product information search process and their product choice. The combination of stated and revealed preference methods applied in the studies is therefore appropriate to model ethical behaviour and to arrive at conclusions which are in line with actual market figures. The dissertation is characterised by its intensive combination of theoretical and empirical research. It furthermore contributes to the literature as the method triangulation applied in the different surveys reveals previously unknown relationships between different kinds of ethical behaviour, such as ethical consumption and charitable giving, as well as between different forms of ethical products. Choice experiment, latent class analysis, the information display matrix and item-based attitude assessment allowed the comparison of stated and revealed preferences as well as an analysis of the relevance of ethical product features within the context of different product and process attributes. The dissertation provides insights into a research field which is becoming more and more relevant and improves the understanding of consumers' assessment and the interdependencies of the possibilities of ethical behaviour. This allows the development of recommendations for consumer policy makers, business and NGOs concerned with the ethics of consumer choices as well as future research on ethical behaviour in general and ethical consumption in particular. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.

abstract = {We investigate how the provision of objective information about the environmental and health impact of organic labels by policy makers can influence the willingness-to-pay of consumers for labeled organic apples in Flanders (Belgium). Using a stated choice experiment, we initially find that Flemish consumers are willing to pay a positive price premium of some 33 eurocent per kilogram for labeled organic apples. After the provision of information on the actual environmental and health effects of organic apple production, this price premium becomes even more pronounced and increases to 57 eurocent per kilogram. Using a conditional logit model with covariates and a mixed logit model, we find evidence of preference heterogeneity. Also, the effect of information provision is more pronounced for certain groups of consumers such as non-vegetarians, infrequent buyers of organic products and members of a nature protection organization. As such, this paper illustrates that there is a role for policy makers and CSR producers in providing more accurate and reliable information about socially responsible production processes. Moreover, it is important to take the observed preference heterogeneity into account and tailor policies to specific consumer groups. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The objective was to explore the importance that consumers attach to sustainability attributes and investigate how this relates to the visual attention paid to these attributes during the choice decision and to willingness-to-pay (WTP). Visual attention during the decision making process was measured in terms of fixation time and fixation count, which were then analyzed in relation to the stated attribute importance. Our results suggest that consumer segments with differences in stated attribute importance, visually attend differently to these attributes. Higher valued attributes also exhibited higher visual attention. Our results suggest that consumers who spend more time attending to and fixate more on sustainability attributes value them more.},

This paper links changing global coffee markets to opportunities and vulnerabilities for sustaining small-scale farmer livelihoods in northern Nicaragua. Changing governance structures, corporate concentration, oversupply, interchangeable commodity grade beans, and low farm gate prices characterize the crisis in conventional coffee markets. In contrast, certified Fair Trade and organic are two alternative forms of specialty coffee trade and production that may offer opportunities for small-scale producers. A research team surveyed 228 farmers to measure the impact of sales on organic and Fair Trade markets. The results suggest that participation in organic and Fair Trade networks reduces farmers’ livelihood vulnerability."

This paper explores consumers' revealed purchasing behaviour with regard to fair trade coffee and is apparently the first to do so in an actual market setting. In a series of experiments, we investigated differences in consumer responsiveness to relative price changes in fair trade and non-fair trade brewed coffees. In order to minimize the hypothetical bias that may be present in some experimental settings, we conducted our experiments in cooperation with a vendor who allowed us to vary prices in an actual coffee shop. Using a choice model we found that purchasers of fair trade coffee were much less price responsive than those of other coffee products. The demonstration of low sensitivity to price suggests that the market premiums identified by stated preference studies do indeed exist and are not merely artifacts of hypothetical settings.},

This study seeks to explore the determinants of coffee consumption in China with a specific focus on fair trade coffee. In a survey of 564 respondents in Wuhan City, consumers' willingness to pay (WTP)for fair trade labeled coffee was measured. This study uses an interval regression to investigate individual demographic and consumption characteristic impacts on WTP. Results show that on average, consumers were willing to pay 22{\%} more for a medium cup of fair trade coffee compared with traditional coffee. In addition, other variables that indicated a higher WTP included female consumers, consumers who made their own coffee, and consumers who planned to consume more coffee in the following year.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Abstract: We investigate whether beer drinkers are willing to pay a price premium for organic beer compared to conventional beer. Moreover, we identify subgroups of consumers with different preference patterns by investigating whether specific personal characteristics of the purchasers have an influence on this willingness-to-pay. Specifically, results are reported from a survey including a stated choice experiment of consumer decisions concerning beer purchases in Flanders (Belgium), focusing on organic labels. A non-probabilistic sampling method was used over the Internet and 334 responses were useable for the empirical analysis. Each respondent was asked to choose their preferred beer from a series of nine choice cards describing three different beer varieties. In this respect, we created a two-block design, each consisting of nine choice cards. Each respondent was randomly presented with one of the two blocks, so that an equal distribution of the blocks could be obtained. Overall, we find that our sample is statistically indifferent between a beer with an organic label and a similar beer without an organic label. This is in line with previous research that stated that consumers are unwilling to pay high price premiums for organic vice products, such as beer. We find no statistically different preferences for male or female respondents, or for members or non-members of nature protection organizations. However, we find a significant difference (p-value = 0.029) between primary beer shoppers who have a zero willingness-to-pay (WTP) for organic beer compared to similar non-organic beer and the reference group that has a negative WTP of 14 Euro per 1.5 L for organic beer. In addition, the WTP for beer drinkers older than 40 (negative WTP of 22 Euro per 1.5 L) and the WTP for frequent beer drinkers (zero WTP) are statistically different from the reference group (p-value = 0.019 and 0.000 respectively).},

The subjects received pineapple pieces of three regularly grown varieties, in which information about organic production and fair trade was systematically varied. Taken over all subjects, organic or fair trade information did not seem to have much influence on liking or on perception. Although they seemed to positively affect liking when presented alone, in combination, they did not. When subjects were grouped according to their - indirectly measured - affective attitudes towards organic or fair trade products by means of conjoint analysis, perception differed as a result of the information provided. Subjects with a positive attitude towards organic or fair trade information perceived the products to have an overall stronger sensory impact in the presence of such information than its in absence, whereas the opposite was true for subjects with a negative attitude towards organic or fair trade information. When the subjects are considered as a uniform group, the individual differences indicating different outcome of underlying cognitive processes cannot be revealed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Previous research has extensively studied consumer's environmental and social concerns. However, measuring the value of the environmental or social dimension of a product remains a challenge. This paper proposes to partially fill this gap by measuring the double 'Fair Trade and organic' labels' value using an experimental method - the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak's mechanism. Two 'organic and Fair Trade' and two conventional chocolate products were tested on a sample of 102 consumers. Results show that organic and Fair Trade labels increase consumers' willingness to pay, and allow the identification of three consumers clusters. The first cluster represents people insensitive to the label. For the second cluster, the 'organic and Fair Trade' labels' influence on the improving image of the products is positive and important. And finally, for the third cluster, the valuation of the 'organic and Fair Trade' label is determined by the product's taste. Our research contributes to a better understanding of consumers' valuation of Fair Trade and organic labels, leading to our conclusions, which offer managerial implications with respect to this market (importance of taste and usefulness of double labels).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists. Labels signaling sustainable product attributes are gaining importance, although uncertainty concerning the environmental, micro- and macroeconomic benefits of such labels persist. One of the questions still incompletely answered is whether Willingness To Pay (WTP) varies with a gradually increasing number of labels on a food product. In order to answer this question, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 191 student respondents, testing consumer valuations of different labeling strategies. Using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism, WTP for 15 food products was measured. The products were endowed with up to six different sustainability labels, such that each grocery item was available in eight product versions. For perishable, nonperishable, and plant-based products, the results indicate that participants are prone to allocating WTP-premiums to labeled products, more than to unlabeled products. For animal products, however, labels do not influence WTP significantly. Furthermore, the premiums do not vary with an increasing number of labels, irrespective of whether the labels signal substitute or complementary sustainability information. The results are not entirely in line with normative notions of magnitude variation, but rather with the behavioral economic concept of embedding effects.},

By means of an Information-Display-Matrix (IDM) and an accompanying consumer survey, the information acquisition behaviour of consumers regarding seven additional ethical attributes and the product price of organic food was investigated in five European countries. The ethical attributes, ‘animal welfare’, ‘regional production’ and ‘fair prices to farmers’ turned out to be the most important. The results also show that the vast majority of consumers of organic food was willing to pay higher prices for organic products with additional ethical attributes. Contrasting the results with those from direct inquiry by means of a ‘single source approach’ revealed considerable differences between both methods, particularly regarding the preferences for the product price relative to some of the ethical attributes. This may serve as evidence for higher external validity of the IDM with respect to social desirability bias."

In many European countries, several different organic labelling schemes exist in the market. The aim of this paper is to elicit whether consumers prefer certain organic labelling schemes over others, to give recommendations for market actors in the organic sector. By means of choice experiments and structured interviews with 2441 consumers of organic food in six European countries, consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for different organic logos were analysed. The results of the random parameter logit models showed that the WTP differed considerably between the tested logos. Consumer perceptions of organic labelling schemes turned out to be of subjective nature and in many cases not based on objective knowledge. We conclude that it is advisable to label organic products with well-known organic certification logos that consumers trust. Organisations owning an organic labelling scheme should put effort into measures for increasing consumer awareness of the logo and forming consumer perceptions and attitudes regarding the underlying scheme in terms of standards and control regime."

Using conjoint analysis to determine marginal WTP, we find support for the idea that as attitudes become more pro-environmental, they more than proportionally boost marginal WTP. We conclude our paper by discussing implications for research and practice that focus on environmental segments of consumers."

Yet to date, the dominant approach for promoting pro-environmental behavior has focused on highlighting the benefits to others or nature, rather than appealing to self-interest. Building on the Inclusion Model for Environmental Concern, we argue that egoistic and biospheric environmental concerns, respectively, conceptualized as self-interest and altruism, are hierarchically structured, such that altruism is inclusive of self-interest. Three studies show that self-interested individuals will behave more pro-environmentally when the behavior results in a personal benefit (but not when there is exclusively an environmental benefit), while altruistic individuals will engage in pro-environmental behaviors when there are environmental benefits, and critically, also when there are personal benefits. The reported findings have implications for programs and policies designed to promote pro-environmental behavior, and for social science research aimed at understanding human responses to a changing environment.

This study is conducted based on this multidimensionality concept to analyse willingness to pay for forest management targeting non-use value ecosystem services. In most previous studies, the NEP scale has been considered as a unidimensional measure and directly incorporated into the modelling. Here, we outline the relevance of considering such multidimensionality of the NEP scale using a different modelling procedure. This is performed following two modelling approaches (1) a random parameters logit model where the NEP score is incorporated directly and (2) a hybrid choice model in which latent variables identified from the NEP scale are incorporated in simultaneous equations setup. In both models, the environmental attitude influences preferences and willingness to pay estimates, but the first one ignoring the multidimensionality tends to exaggerate its impact. The hybrid choice model shows slightly lower statistical performance. However, in this model, the use of two latent variables reveal a non-uniform effect and thereby clearly shows the relevance of considering a multidimensional NEP scale for a better understanding of variations. }

This study examined the concept of self-construal as a social aspect of self that influences different levels of ecological beliefs, which, in turn, affect ecotourism behavior. To address the unsatisfactory predictive power of the belief/attitude-behavior model, this study included the willingness to pay (WTP) for ecotourism between the ecological belief and ecotourism behavior relationships. Finally, this study examined the impact of ecotourism on tourists’ satisfaction with life as a result of ecotourism behavior. A structural equation model was constructed to test the proposed model. We found significant impacts of self-construals in explaining ecological beliefs. Significant relationships were found between ecological belief and WTP for ecotourism services which influenced ecotourism behavior, and between ecological belief and ecotourism behavior which affected satisfaction with life. The moderating effect of gender was only found on the path between WTP and ecotourism behavior. The findings of this study offer some implications for industry and policymakers to develop effective ecotourism programs.},

This approach has its roots in Lancaster's characteristics theory of value, in random utility theory and in experimental design.We showhowmarginal values for the attributes of environmental assets, such as forests and rivers, can be estimated from pair-wise choices, as well as the value of the environmental asset as a whole. These choice pairs are designed so as to allow efficient statistical estimation of the underlying utility function, and to minimise required sample size. Choice experiments have important advantages over other environmental valuation methods, such as contingent valuation and travel cost- type models, although many design issues remain unresolved. Applications to environmental issues have so far been relatively limited. We illustrate the use of choice experiments with reference to a recent UK study on public preferences for alternative forest landscapes. This study allows us to perform a convergent validity test on the choice experiment estimates of willingness to pay.},

abstract = {We briefly review and discuss traditional conjoint analysis (CA) and discrete choice experiments (DCEs), widely used stated preference elicitation methods in several disciplines. We pay particular attention to the origins and basis of CA, and show that it is generally inconsistent with economic demand theory, and is subject to several logical inconsistencies that make it unsuitable for use in applied economics, particularly welfare and policy assessment. We contrast this with DCEs that have a long-standing, well-tested theoretical basis in random utility theory, and we show why and how DCEs are more general and consistent with economic demand theory. Perhaps the major message, though, is that many studies that claim to be doing conjoint analysis are really doing DCE.},

abstract = {The growing number of voluntary standards for governing transnational arenas is presenting standards organizations with a problem. While claiming that they are pursuing shared, overarching objectives, at the same time they are promoting their own respective standards that are increasingly similar. By developing the notion of 'standards markets', this paper examines this tension and studies how different social movement and industry-driven standards organizations compete as well as collaborate over governance in transnational arenas. Based on an in-depth case study of sustainability standards in the global coffee industry, we find that the ongoing co-existence of multiple standards is being promoted by the interplay between two countervailing mechanisms: convergence and differentiation. In conjunction, these mechanisms are enabling the emergence and persistence of a market for standards through what we describe as meta-standardization of sustainable practices. Meta-standardization leads to convergence at the 'rules of the game' level, but allows also differentiation at the attributes level, which is enabling parties to create and maintain their own standards. Our study helps to advance the understanding of transnational governance by explaining the dynamics of competing and collaborating non-state actors in constituting a standards market. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {There has been rapid development in the methods, data and protocols for the assessment of product sustainability over the past decade. Notwithstanding this welcome development, the widespread provision of sustainable products has not occurred. Moreover, indications from a myriad of surveys suggest that consumers remain full of intent to purchase sus- tainably, yet these stated preferences have not translated into a widespread uptake in the purchase of more sustainable products. Heightened interest in climate change over the past couple of years has led to rising calls for labelling to allow consumers to differentiate between more or less sustainable options. Such calls apparently assume that if consumers are presented with appropriate label information their purchases will change and more sustainable purchasing will result. For many observers these calls bring more than a ring of déjà vu as the failures (or at least unfulfilled expectations) of environmental labelling schemes of the past spring to mind. A review and assessment of eco-labelling schemes is presented. Discussion focuses on the history, successes and failures of such schemes, and consideration of their potential role (or not) in future shifts towards sustainable consumption. Behavioural, social practice, institutional and infrastructure factors are considered and labelling, legislation and other options are explored. Conclusions are drawn regarding potential routes to sustainable consumption, with particular reference to eco-labels.},

abstract = {Abstract Since the early 1990s, tourism companies, mostly hotel facilities, have undertaken different voluntary initiatives to show their commitment to sustainable tourism. Among the voluntary tools applied by the hotel industry, the most common are codes of conduct, best environmental practices, eco-labels, environmental management systems (EMSs) and environmental performance indicators. This article presents the findings of empirical research conducted with Spanish hotels that have adopted one or more of the existing environmental tools. Based on a qualitative exploration of perceptions and experiences of hotel managers applying these instruments, the general understanding of the concept of sustainable tourism is examined, and the practical application of different voluntary environmental instruments is analysed. In an attempt to interpret the facilitators and barriers reported by hotel companies, three interpretative approaches are combined to explain the selective adoption of environmental tools: the perspective of competitive advantages, the perspective of stakeholders' influence and the perspective of the human cognitive process.

abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between consumer motivation, understanding and use of sustainability labels on food products (both environmental and ethical labels), which are increasingly appearing on food products. Data was collected by means of an online survey implemented in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Poland, with a total sample size of 4408 respondents. Respondents expressed medium high to high levels of concern with sustainability issues at the general level, but lower levels of concern in the context of concrete food product choices. Understanding of the concept of sustainability was limited, but understanding of four selected labels (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Carbon Footprint, and Animal Welfare) was better, as some of them seem to be self-explanatory. The results indicated a low level of use, no matter whether use was measured as self-reported use of different types of information available on food labels or as use inferred from the results of a choice-based conjoint analysis. Hierarchical regression indicated that use is related to both motivation and understanding, and that both motivation, understanding and use are affected by demographic characteristics, human values as measured by the Schwartz value domains, and country differences. The results imply that sustainability labels currently do not play a major role in consumers' food choices, and future use of these labels will depend on the extent to which consumers' general concern about sustainability can be turned into actual behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

The standard approach of specifying the distributions of the coefficients and deriving WTP as the ratio of two coefficients (estimation in preference space) is compared to specifying the distributions for WTP directly at the estimation stage (estimation in WTP space). The models in preference space fit the data better than the corresponding models in WTP space although the difference between the best fitting models in the two estimation regimes is minimal. Moreover, the willingness to pay estimates derived from the preference space models turn out to be unrealistically high for many of the job attributes. The results suggest that sensitivity testing using a variety of model specifications, including estimation in WTP space, is recommended when using mixed logit models to estimate willingness to pay distributions.},

Stated preference data was collected using contingent valuation studies. Revealed preference data came from an experiment where all survey participants received a personally identifiable voucher redeemable for a free bakery item when the holder purchased a coffee. We compared estimates of mean and median WTP a price premium for shade-grown coffee from stated preference data with similar estimates from revealed preference data. We used a logit model to evaluate the effect of explanatory variables (measures of environmental attitudes, personal norms for pro-environmental behaviour and demographic variables) on respondents' WTP a price premium for shade grown coffee. Model parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood approach. Respondents with higher scores on measures of environmental attitudes and personal norms for pro-environmental behaviour were, on average, willing to pay more for shade-grown coffee. While this paper examined a specific case, purchase of shade-grown coffee, our results confirmed that stated environmental concern was a good predictor of pro-environmental behaviour. We found that mean and median WTP estimates from stated preference methods were higher, but not significantly different than mean and median WTP estimates from actual purchases, indicating convergent validity between stated and realized preference methods. The majority of individuals both stated WTP a price premium and purchased shade-grown coffee at a price premium. We did, however notice some interesting behaviour at the individual level where stated preferences under-predicted realized preferences at low price-premia and over-predicted realized preferences at high price premia.},

They believe its arouses more trust, has a better quality, is subject to more strict controls, and is produced in a more traditional way. According to Polish consumers, the most important characteristics of organic food are healthiness and high quality. The perceived authenticity of organic food depends on its natural taste, product quality, labelling, in particular having a European quality sign, as well as the retailer type and a separate exposition place in the points of purchase (merchandising). The critical barrier to the development of the organic food market in Poland is the high price, followed by an insufficient consumer awareness, low availability of organic products, short expiry dates and low visibility in the shop. The principal motives of organic food selection in Poland include: healthiness, ecological character of the product, food safety considerations, superior taste, and quality assurance.

Using psychometric scaling techniques, we measure individuals' degree of altruism and propensity toward free riding. Results of a random parameter logit model applied to choice data obtained from a nationwide survey in the United States indicates that more altruistic individuals are willing to pay more for pork products with public good attributes than less altruistic individuals and free riders. These results indicate that private purchases of goods with public-good attributes are not simply a result of individuals' perceptions of the ability to mitigate private risks such as food safety, but that individuals are making private choices to affect public outcomes. Results have implications for policy makers weighing the relative costs and benefits of food labeling policies versus bans related to certain livestock production practices.},

abstract = {Japan and Thailand have joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which introduces cheaper US-produced rice into the domestic markets of these countries. This study investigates consumers' preferences for cheaper US-produced rice in Japan and Thailand. To compare the willingness to pay for rice in these two countries, we employ a choice experiment that comprises five attributes: country of origin, fair trade label, cultivation method, taste ranking, and price. The random parameter logit model estimation results show that Japanese people prefer organic rice more than Thai people do and dislike US rice much more than Thai people do. Thai people prefer fair trade more than Japanese people do. The willingness to pay for taste ranking is identical across these countries. Taste ranking has the lowest and second lowest willingness to pay in Japan and Thailand, respectively. Further, gender is the most influential socioeconomic characteristic. Japanese women prefer premium rice with various attributes and dislike US-produced rice more than Thai women do. These results suggest that US-produced rice is unacceptable for Japanese people regardless of the price level, while it could be acceptable for Thai people if the price level is adequately low. Additionally, it is reasonable for Japanese rice producers to grow organic rice to compete in the market, while Thai rice suppliers prefer to enhance their fair trade labels.},

abstract = {In some, but not all, contexts, respondents to stated preference valuation studies state a willingness to pay (WTP) higher than what lab or field experiments indicate is the actual amount they would pay. However, several ex ante survey design strategies and ex post calibration techniques can be used to minimize or eliminate hypothetical bias. This article reviews and presents evidence on the effectiveness of these ex ante and ex post approaches. The ex ante approaches lead to recommendations to modify survey designs to minimize the bias up front. If the analyst desires, ex post calibration of WTP using certainty scales can be used to reduce stated WTP to the point at which it will match actual cash contributions.},

abstract = {In many companies pricing decisions are made without profound understanding of the hkely response of the buyers and competitors. These companies do not conduct pricing research and as a result do not have a serious pricing strategy in a marketing sense. They rather have something that could be called an intuitive pricing strategy. Several studies indicate that only 8{\%} to 15{\%} of the companies conduct serious pricing research to develop effective pricing strategies (Monroe and Cox, 2001). Other studies have shown that 49.9{\%} of the surveyed companies adjust prices once or less in a typical year. Further, only 13{\%} of the prices that were changed were a result of a scheduled review of the current pricing policy (Monroe, 2003, p. 19). In contrast to what seems to be common practice, managers consider the knowledge of customers' response behavior to different prices to be the cornerstone of most marketing strategies, particularly in the areas of product development, value audits, and competitive strategy (Anderson et al., 1993). On the importance of vahd estimates of willingness-to-pay (WTP) researchers agree with managers. Balderjahn (2003, p. 387) considers valid estimates of wilhngness-to-pay to be essential for developing an optimal pricing strategy in marketing. Such estimates can be used to forecast market response to price changes and for modeling demand functions. In this chapter different methods that are applied for measuring willingness-to-pay are introduced. We classify these methods and give references to substantial theoretical and empirical work. The advantages and drawbacks of the methods are discussed. The discus-sion of the different methods clearly indicates that the best method that should be used does not exist. Rather it depends on the objective of the marketer. If costly methods can be applied and quick results are not of main interest, different pricing strategies can be tested with field experiments in real market settings. If estimations of willingness-to-pay are needed frequently, it can be more efficient to apply less time consuming and less costly surveying techniques. At the end of the chapter it will be demonstrated that within indirect surveying there is a method missing which has both the ability to estimate willingness-to-pay at the individual level based on each respondents information and exphcitly ehcits choice behavior during the interview.},

Researchers use these statistical methods to examine the choices that consumers, households, firms, and other agents make. Each of the major models is covered: logit, generalized extreme value, or GEV (including nested and cross-nested logits), probit, and mixed logit, plus a variety of specifications that build on these basics. Simulation-assisted estimation procedures are investigated and compared, including maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, and method of simulated scores. Procedures for drawing from densities are described, including variance reduction techniques such as anithetics and Halton draws. Recent advances in Bayesian procedures are explored, including the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs sampling. No other book incorporates all these fields, which have arisen in the past 20 years. The procedures are applicable in many fields, including energy, transportation, environmental studies, health, labor, and marketing.},

abstract = {Preferences elicited in hypothetical settings have recently come underscrutiny, causing estimates from the contingent valuation method to bechallenged due to perceived ``hypothetical bias.'' Given that the receivedliterature derives value estimates using heterogeneous experimentaltechniques, understanding the effects of important design parameters onthe magnitude of hypothetical bias is invaluable. In this paper, we addressthis issue statistically by using a meta-analysis to examine data from 29experimental studies. Our empirical findings suggest that on averagesubjects overstate their preferences by a factor of about 3 in hypotheticalsettings, and that the degree of over-revelation is influenced by thedistinction between willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept, publicversus private goods, and several elicitation methods.

abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were contin- ued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normal- ity after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random- effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

abstract = {Food consumers face uncertainty and demand high quality and safe food products, apparently with as much information as possible. Today's agriculture and food industry aims at reducing market failures from information asymmetry. Such information provision can be successful only if it meets the information needs of the target audience. This paper focuses first on individual characteristics that shape information needs, and then discusses information provision through mass media and labelling. It emerges that consumer needs for information cannot be taken for granted. The provision of ever more and too detailed information entails a risk of information overload, resulting in consumer indifference or loss of confidence. Instead, segmentation and targeted information provision are proposed as potential solutions to market failure from information asymmetry. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The purposes of this article are (1) to understand the factors that have led Fair Trade to become a mixed-form market and (2) to propose some trails to understand the market dynamics that result from the interactions between the different types of players. We start by defining briefly Fair Trade, its different dimensions (including the “fair” quality of the products) and its organizational landscape, focusing on the distinction between the pioneer “Alternative Trading Organizations” and the second-mover companies. Then, we recall the theoretical emergence factors for each type of organization (nonprofit, co-operative and for-profit) and apply these emergence factors to the context of Fair Trade. This analysis allows us to capture the specificities of each type of operator with regard to Fair Trade and, thus, to have a better understanding of the dynamics in the sector. Such dynamics includes competition, but also conflict and partnership. Our analysis includes elements on ethical imitation, consumers' behaviors, effects on welfare and the role of the government.

abstract = {Consumers are faced with an increasing number of sustainable food labels. These different labels may be complementary or add to the increasing competition of product information in consumers' minds.We investigate: (1) the perceptions that consumers in the UK have about sustainable labels vs. other labels, such as origin or nutrition labels; and (2) con- sumers' reactions to combinations of different sustainable labels. Overall, the findings from two focus groups conducted in the UK indicate that consumers have positive per- ceptions of organic and fair trade labels but tend to be sceptical about unfamiliar labels and general claims such as ‘climate friendly'. The results also indicate the importance of familiarity, trust and fit between combinations of labels as well as between associating a label with a brand. While the combination of certain labels can enhance the value of a food product, this study also indicates that other label combinations (e.g. private and sustainable label) can detract from a label's value. Implications and recommendations are suggested for managers to counter the image of greenwashing, and for policy makers to facilitate sustainable food choices.},

Attention is focused on three major effects: (a) direct tangible impact of FT arrangements on the income, welfare, and livelihoods of rural households; (b) indirect effects of fair trade for improving credit access, capital stocks, investments, and attitudes to risk; and (c) institutional implications of fair trade for farmers' organisations and externalities for local and regional employment, bargaining, and trading conditions. Although direct effects in terms of net income remain fairly modest, important benefits are found to include capitalising farmers and strengthening their organisations.},

abstract = {Consumers' food choices and dietary behaviour can be markedly affected by communication and information. Whether the provided information is processed by the receiver, and thus becomes likely to be effective, depends on numerous factors. The role of selected determinants such as uncertainty, knowledge, involvement, health-related motives and trust, as well as message content variables, are discussed in the present paper based on previous empirical studies. The different studies indicate that: uncertainty about meat quality and safety does not automatically result in more active information search; subjective knowledge about fish is a better predictor of fish consumption than objective knowledge; high subjective knowledge about functional foods as a result of a low trusted information source such as mass media advertising leads to a lower probability of adopting these foods in the diet. Also, evidence of the stronger impact of negative news as compared with messages promoting positive outcomes of food choices is discussed. Finally, three audience-segmentation studies based on consumers' involvement with fresh meat, individuals' health-related-motive orientations and their use of and trust in fish information sources are presented. A clear message from these studies is that communication and information provision strategies targeted to a specific audience's needs, interests or motives stand a higher likelihood of being attended to and processed by the receiving audience, and therefore also stand a higher chance of yielding their envisaged impact in terms of food choice and dietary behaviour.},

Validity and reliability are two fundamental elements in the evaluation of a measurement instrument. Instruments can be convention- al knowledge, skill or attitude tests, clinical simulations or survey questionnaires. Instruments can measure concepts, psychomotor skills or affective values. Validity is con- cerned with the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is concerned with the ability of an instrument to measure consistently.1 It should be noted that the reliability of an instrument is closely associated with its validity. An instrument cannot be valid unless it is reliable. However, the reliability of an instrument does not depend on its validity.2 It is possible to objectively measure the reliability of an instrument and in this paper we explain the meaning of Cronbach's alpha, the most widely used objective measure of reliability.},

In general the two approaches are equivalent, in that any mutually compatible distributions for coefficients and WTP can be represented in either way. How- ever, in practice, convenient distributions, such as normal or log-normal, are usually specified, and these convenient distributions have different implications when placed on WTP's than on coefficients. We compare models that use normal and log-normal distributions for coefficients (called models in preference space) with models using these distributions for WTP (called models in WTP space). We find that the models in preference space fit the data better but provide less reasonable distributions of WTP than the models in WTP space. Our findings suggests that further work is needed to identify distributions that either fit bet- ter when applied in WTP space or imply more reasonable distributions of WTP when applied in preference space.},

abstract = {We investigate direct and indirect specification of the distribution of consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for changes in product attributes in a choice setting. Typically, choice models identify WTP for an attribute as a ratio of the estimated attribute and price coefficients. Previous research in marketing and economics has discussed the problems with allowing for random coefficients on both attribute and price, especially when the distribution of the price coefficient has mass near zero. These problems can be avoided by combining a parameterization of the likelihood function that directly identifies WTP with a normal prior for WTP. We show that the typical likelihood parameterization in combination with what are regarded as standard heterogeneity distributions for attribute and price coefficients results in poorly behaved posterior WTP distributions, especially in small sample settings. The implied prior for WTP readily allows for substantial mass in the tails of the distribution and extreme individual-level estimates of WTP. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of profit maximizing prices to parameterization and priors for WTP.},

abstract = {Random coefficient models such as mixed logit are increasingly being used to allow for random heterogeneity in willingness to pay (WTP) measures. In the most commonly used specifications, the distribution of WTP for an attribute is derived from the distribution of the ratio of individual coefficients. Since the cost coefficient enters the denominator, its distribution plays a major role in the distribution of WTP. Depending on the choice of distribution for the cost coefficient, and its implied range, the distribution of WTP may or may not have finite moments. In this paper, we identify a criterion to determine whether, with a given distribution for the cost coefficient, the distribution of WTP has finite moments. Using this criterion, we show that some popular distributions used for the cost coefficient in random coefficient models, including normal, truncated normal, uniform and triangular, imply infinite moments for the distribution of WTP, even if truncated or bounded at zero. We also point out that relying on simulation approaches to obtain moments of WTP from the estimated distribution of the cost and attribute coefficients can mask the issue by giving finite moments when the true ones are infinite.},

A Random Parameter Logit model was estimated to elicit consumers' WTP. The results showed that Jiangsu consumers' WTP for pork with a ``Organic Food{\{}''{\}} certification (26.78 Yuan) was the highest among all attributes, followed by ``Green Food{\{}''{\}} certification (20.22 Yuan), ``free from veterinary drug residues{\{}''{\}} label (23.18 Yuan), and location-of-origin (12.77 Yuan). However, there was only a moderate preference for `` Safe Food{\{}''{\}} certification (8.10 Yuan). In addition, respondents from the more developed region (i.e., Jiangsu) had significantly higher WTP for all attributes than respondents from Anhui, a less developed region. The Random Parameter Logit model shows that better educational attainment and higher income were two factors that were associated with a higher WTP. The main policy recommendations are that public awareness of the different types of verifications should be improved and that authorization of certification logos should be enforced strictly so that food with certification logos are always reflective of the standard being followed.},

@article{Dettmann2008,
abstract = {Fueled by an increasingly health conscious and environmentally aware consumer base, organic produce, the largest organic sector, has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years. With growth rates averaging 15 percent over the past eight years and sales totaling {\$}5.4 billion in 2006, organic produce is expected to play a consistently important role within the organic industry with sales expected to increase an average of 7 percent between 2007 and 2010 (Nutrition Business Journal, 2007).Understanding the types of consumers who purchase organic produce is particularly important for growers, processors, and retailers since organic produce has long been considered a ‘gateway' product with consumers often entering the organic market by first purchasing organic produce and subsequently widening their purchases to include other organic products (Hartman, 2000, 2002). Growth in organic food sales is induced both by growing consumer demand for organic food and greater accessibility in retail outlets. Consumer demand for fresh produce has exploded in recent years with per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables increasing 27 percent between 1970 and 2005 (ERS USDA, 2007). In response to growing demand from convenience orientated customers, retailers have introduced and experienced booming sales in organic precut produce (such as bagged salads and baby carrots). As a result of the upsurge in consumer demand, many food retail outlets, including conventional supermarkets and mass merchandisers, have added organic fruits and vegetables to their shelves, increasing consumer access to organic produce. As the organic market grows, a natural question arises: who is buying organic food? Gaining insight into this issue is more than just an intellectual exercise, as retailers and members of the organic industry (for example, farmers, processors, distributors) can further maximize profits by understanding who buys their products. One approach to discovering who buys organic food is to develop a profile of the organic consumer by analyzing purchase and household demographic data, with the intent of identifying which consumers are more likely to buy organic food, or in this case, organic produce. This type of analysis was not possible until the recent addition of organic products to the Nielsen Homescan dataset, opening up new possibilities for consumer research. For the purpose of organic research, Homescan data provides the richest information currently available since it captures purchasing patterns for each household, as well as providing demographic information about each panel household. This paper uses purchase and household demographic data to characterize organic produce consumers, and is part of an ongoing, broader effort to gain insight into organic consumers. To accomplish this, produce purchase information from Nielsen's 2006 panel of 41,000 households is utilized. Two research objectives are achieved: one, which demographic characteristics influence the likelihood that a household will buy organic produce, and two, once the decision to buy organic produce is made, what share of produce purchases will be organic? A Heckman two-stage model is used to examine this decision, since it is assumed consumers make purchase decisions in two phases. The first stage examines which demographic characteristics influence the likelihood that consumers purchase organic produce, and the second stage analyzes which demographic factors influence the share of produce expenditures devoted to organic produce.},

@article{Hess2012,
abstract = {There is growing interest in the notion that a significant component of the heterogeneity retrieved in random coefficients models may actually relate to variations in absolute sensitivities, a phenomenon referred to as scale heterogeneity. As a result, a number of authors have tried to explicitly model such scale heterogeneity, which is shared across coefficients, and separate it from heterogeneity in individual coefficients. This direction of work has in part motivated the development of specialised modelling tools such as the G-MNL model. While not disagreeing with the notion that scale heterogeneity across respondents exists, this paper argues that attempts in the literature to disentangle scale heterogeneity from heterogeneity in individual coefficients in discrete choice models are misguided. In particular, we show how the various model specifications can in fact simply be seen as different parameterisations, and that any gains in fit obtained in random scale models are the result of using more flexible distributions, rather than an ability to capture scale heterogeneity. We illustrate our arguments through an empirical example and show how the conclusions from past work are based on misinterpretations of model results.},

abstract = {Support for efficient multicasting in WLANs can enable new services such as streaming of TV channels, radio channels, and visitor's information. With increasing deployments of large-scale WLANs, such services can be made available to a large number of users. However, any new multicast based services must minimally impact the existing unicast services which are currently the core services offered by most WLANs. In this paper, we leverage the flexibility of associating with different access-points (APs), which occurs often due to overlapping coverage of APs, to optimize the network's objective. Motivated by different revenue functions and network scenarios, three different optimization objectives are considered which are: maximizing the number of admitted users (MNU), balancing the load among APs (BLA), and minimizing the load of APs (MLA). We show that these problems are NP-hard and present centralized approximation algorithms and distributed approaches to solve them. These algorithms compute which AP a user should be associated with. Using simulations we evaluate their performance and compare them to a naive approach in which users associate to the AP with the best RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator).},

abstract = "In many studies, consumer preferences are determined by using direct surveys. For this method social desirability is problematic. This leads to the effect that participants answer in a way that they perceive as desired by society. This leads to the stated importance of certain features in these studies not being reflected in real purchasing decisions. Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare consumer preferences measured by a quasi-experiment to those quantified by direct questions. Another objective is to quantify the part-worth utilities of product characteristics such as origin, price and food labels. Part-worth utilities are estimated on an interval scale with an arbitrary origin and are a measure for preferences. The real purchasing situation was simulated in a quasi-experiment using a choice-based conjoint analysis. The part-worth utilities were then compared with the results of a conventional preference assessment (Likert scale). For this purpose, 645 consumers from all over Germany were surveyed in 2014. The participants were on average 44 years old and 63\% were women. The results of the conjoint analysis report the highest part-worth utility (2.853) for the lowest price (1.49€), followed by the characteristic “grown locally” (2.157). For the labels, the German organic label shows the highest part-worth utility (0.785) followed by Fairtrade/“A heart for the producer” (0.200). It is noticeable that the carbon footprint labels have negative part-worth utilities compared to tomatoes without a label (−0.130 with CO2 indication, −0.186 without CO2 indication). The price is ranked 12th in the importance of the characteristics of purchasing tomatoes in the survey with a Likert scale, whereas it is first in the evaluation of the quasi-experiment (conjoint analysis), which supports the assumption of a social desirability bias."

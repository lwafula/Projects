 Q1: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Education". Give the Cookâ€™s distance of observation 15 multiplied by 1000. 

 Q2: Perform a one-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factor "Department". Afterwards, test all pairwise contrasts with the Tukey method. Give the p-value of the contrast "Department 3 - Department 2". 

 Q3: Assume you want to perform a one-way ANOVA. You expect the group means to be 55, 60, 57 en 62. Assume that the standard deviation within the groups equals 6. What is the power of the global F-test if there would be 20 observations in each group, given a significance level of 0,05. 

 Q4: Perform a two-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factors "Gender" and "Department" (with interaction effect). Give the MSE value.

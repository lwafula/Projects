 Q2: Perform a regression with dependent variable "Salary" and independent variable "Education". Give the hat-value of observation 35. 

 Q3: Perform a one-way ANOVA with response variable "Salary" and factor "Department". Afterwards, test all pairwise contrasts with the Tukey method. Give the p-value of the contrast "Department 4 - Department 1". 

 Q4: Explain the "Salary" in terms of "Employed", "Gender" and "Department". Is there a difference in the salaries by department when one controls for years employed and gender? Provide the p-value associated with the Type II SS for department.

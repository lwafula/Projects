> Machine learning-deep learning in discrete choice experiments: Literature review - paper


> ANOVA codes/slides
-- can work on the codes to use tidyverse but that can only be the only project because it is very manual changing everything
-- ANOVA diagnostics and remedial measures?
-- glht in multicomp package vs your code for testing Tukey?
-- different ways of formulating an ANOVA model as a regression: cell means, weighted and unweighted factor effects?
-- unequal sample sizes? the ANOVA decomposition no longer holds in this case, thus the need to use a regression approach
-- estimable functions? in cases where the X matrix is not of full rank i.e. for overparameterized models

> Data
-- StatBombR sports data; can identify a few variables and a response to compare players profiles/ team's tactics etc

Queries

Release conditions are only for the content. Gradebook's version of release conditions is to make it available and post for a few participants. unfortunately, even if you filter by group, you cannot post by a group
* 1.	Is it possible to make the tests available by time and group membership?
** a)	We tried to create a group of testers and noticed that items under Gradebook do not allow Release with conditions. We were hoping that it would be possible to release the feedbacks with conditions so that we can have a group of testers to test that they are working even when hidden for other participants. Do you know how this can be done?
** b)	Is it possible to set an automated date/time for the tests to be visible to participants? A button like the one for due date but for the availability date for the test to be visible to participants. 
Aa. not possible for now. Gradebook's way of releasing to a few testers would be to make them available to everyone, and only post to the testers. The others will see the Gradebook, but not the feedback column
Ab. not possible for now

* 2.	We downloaded a csv file for group membership from the ATSTAT test course “NIETS MEER IN AANPASSEN [TEST ATstat (voorlopig)]”  and noticed that it had:
** a.	an empty first row (not expected) 
** b.	automatically separated by the semi-colon (;) instead of the comma (,). 
      Is it possible to check this so that every csv that is downloaded is comma separated? 

Aa. the empty row is because of an unrolled participant. The unenrolled participant's info is retained in the system, but as an inactive participant. Which is why when downloaded, there's an empty row
Ab. Toledo is working on an internal system that will be aligned with usual CSVs being comma separated. To be available in a week

* 3.	Is it possible to make a previewer user to see the tasks even if they are hidden for other participants?
A. The easiest way is to post for the previewer (and any other participant you want) only and have it visible to participants. That way, the other participants
can see the Gradebook, but without the seeing the feedback column

Feedbacks have to be created in the Gradebook. Those in contents will come with content and settings without the feedback tab

25-08-2023: meeting with Martina
: create feedback/data/questions folders on https://feb.kuleuven.be/public/u0118298/, similar to Martina's https://feb.kuleuven.be/martina.vandebroek/public/ddlDLHdt
:: check her email

**** creating data/feedbacks/questions on public folder *****

Dear,
yes that is possible, you make different folders per person on your W-drive in your Windows explorer and then give the different links to the persons who need it.
For example 
https://feb.kuleuven.be/public/U0118298/person1/file1
https://feb.kuleuven.be/public/U0118298/person2/file2
etc...
 
 
You should be careful because whatever is public can be seen by anyone. So if they change person1 by person2 in the path they will see the questions of the other person.
But if that is no problem you can use the public drive. If that is a problem then you should use onedrive and give only the correct person access rights to their own folder.
 
 
Met Vriendelijke Groeten/Kind Regards,

Dieter Vranken
